# Cargo-Transfer-Machine

This program generates the simulation of a four-bar mechanism to unload the suitcase or cargo from the plane's luggage area to the ground with as little rotation of the items as possible.
The program needs to be run on MATLAB, and all files should be in same directory.
Based on the defined precision point of cargo, the program also calculated the optimize length, kinematic analysis (displacement, velocity and acceleration), dynamic analysis, and coupler curve of four linkages.
